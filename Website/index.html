            <h2>About this Website</h2>
            <p>
                For the website, we initially split our information into a Home, Project Selection, and SRS page. The
                Home page
                contained information about each team member as well as their role in the project. The project selection
                and SRS pages
                provided general information about the application and its features. Because none of us were very
                familiar with HTML and
                CSS prior to this semester, building a website from scratch required a steep learning curve at the
                beginning.

                After a few weeks of designing and redesigning our website, we ultimately decided to consolidate all of
                the necessary
                information onto a single webpage. See Figure 5 in the appendix.
