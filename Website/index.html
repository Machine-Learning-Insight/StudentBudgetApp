            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>
                Building this website required continuous dedication, learning, and trial and error from our team. 
                Prior to this semester, none of us has much experience working with HTML/CSS. Learning these 
                programming languages required a steep learning curve, and we are proud to present what we have accomplished
                during this time. Our goal for this website is to provide a brief overview of our team members, product, and 
                notable project features. This website was programmed using Visual Studio, and hosted using Github Pages. 
                using Github.

            <h2>About This App</h2>
            <p>
                This app was developed using React Native and Visual Studio. It consists of an authentication page that directs to a login
                page or create account page. Once the user signs in, they can access their home page, dashboard, and discover page. The home
                and discover pages display the number of points they have earned with the app, and the dashboard provides statistics regarding
                their spending trends and overall balance. The discover page contains links to external websites of stores and companies offering 
                coupons, online promo codes, and more affordable ways to shop.
